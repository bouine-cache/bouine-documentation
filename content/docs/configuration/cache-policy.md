## TTL selection

bouine picks freshness in this order:

1. `s-maxage`
2. `max-age`
3. `Expires`
4. Route `ttl_default`
5. Heuristic freshness from `Last-Modified` (where allowed)

## Stale serving

```yaml
cache:
  ttl_default: 60s
  stale_while_revalidate: 10s
  stale_if_error: 300s
```

- `stale_while_revalidate`: serve stale while refreshing in the background.
- `stale_if_error`: serve stale when the origin fails, up to the configured window.

## Stayin Alive

When `stale_if_error` expires and the upstream is still down, bouine normally starts returning errors to clients. **Stayin Alive** prevents this — the cached object is served indefinitely until the upstream recovers, regardless of how long ago it expired.

```yaml
routes:
  - match: { path_prefix: /products/ }
    pool: backend
    cache:
      ttl_default: 60s
      stale_if_error: 5m
      stayin_alive: true   # serve stale forever if upstream is down
```

When `stayin_alive: true`:

- If the upstream returns 5xx, bouine serves the last known good response.
- If the upstream is unreachable (connection error, timeout), bouine serves the last known good response.
- If the upstream returns 2xx, the fresh response replaces the stale one as normal.
- If there is **no cached entry at all**, bouine cannot help — it returns 502.

A `WARN` log is emitted on every stale-served request while the upstream is unhealthy:

```json
{"level":"WARN","msg":"stayin-alive: upstream 5xx, serving stale indefinitely","status":503,"key":12345}
```

**When to use it**

Use Stayin Alive for routes where showing slightly stale content is far better than showing an error — product pages, homepages, navigation menus, search results. Do **not** use it for checkout, cart, account, or any route that must reflect real-time state.

## Negative caching

```yaml
cache:
  negative_ttl: 5s
```

Caches 404, 405, 410, and 501 responses briefly. Use this to protect origins from repeated misses.

## Jittered TTLs

```yaml
cache:
  jitter_percent: 10
```

Applies random ±10% TTL jitter to prevent all objects expiring at the same time.

## Cache key headers

```yaml
cache:
  key:
    include_headers:
      - Accept-Language
      - BM-Market
```

Use this when the origin varies by request header. Keep the list short — every extra header increases variant cardinality.

> **Avoid unbounded variants**
>
> Never key on raw `User-Agent`, unbounded cookies, or high-cardinality request IDs. This creates cache fragmentation and can be a cache-poisoning vector.
