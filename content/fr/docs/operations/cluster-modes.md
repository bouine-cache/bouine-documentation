## Verify your mode

```bash
# Prometheus metric: always 1 with the mode label.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9000/metrics | grep bouine_cluster_mode_info

# Admin API: /v1/cluster/peers returns all members in every mode.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1/cluster/peers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${BOUINE_ADMIN_TOKEN}"

# CLI
bouine cluster peers --server 127.0.0.1:9000 --token "${BOUINE_ADMIN_TOKEN}"
```

Expected: every node reports the same `mode` label. If they disagree, the cluster
has a configuration drift — every pod must use the same mode.

## Per-mode expectations

### `strong` (default)

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| Dashboard shows ring | Yes — consistent-hash ring with per-node key slices |
| Peer-fetch metrics increment | `bouine_peer_fetch_hits_total` > 0 |
| Purge hits all nodes | < 1 s via HTTP fan-out |
| Node failure | Keys owned by lost node → cold miss on all nodes for those keys |

**When things go wrong:**

- **Purge didn't propagate.** Check `bouine_cluster_invalidations_http_total`.
  If zero, the admin port may be unreachable. Verify `cluster.tls` config and
  network policies. The gossip broadcast queue provides a secondary delivery path
  (check `bouine_cluster_invalidations_gossip_total`).

- **Peer fetch is slow or failing.** Check `bouine_peer_fetch_duration_seconds`
  (should be < 2 ms on LAN). If elevated, check cluster network health (`kubectl
  get endpoints bouine-headless`). Increase `hop_limit` if node churn is high.

### `eventual`

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| Dashboard shows ring | No — shows per-node fill rates and gossip stats |
| Peer-fetch metrics | Always zero (no peer fetch) |
| Purge propagation | 1–5 s via gossip; stale reads possible during convergence |
| Node failure | No impact — each node has its own cache |

**When things go wrong:**

- **Purge didn't propagate within 5 seconds.** Check gossip membership:
  ```bash
  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1/cluster/peers
  ```
  Should show 3+ nodes on every pod. If a node is missing, check its `cluster.join`
  list and DNS resolution. The headless Service must have
  `publishNotReadyAddresses: true`.

- **Stale reads on one node.** That node may be partitioned. Check
  `bouine_cluster_invalidations_gossip_total` — if the counter hasn't
  incremented recently, the gossip link is broken. Restart the node.

- **Hit rate lower than expected.** Each node cold-starts independently in
  `eventual` mode. Over time, hit rate naturally plateaus as each node fills its
  cache from origin traffic. If load is unevenly distributed across nodes
  (e.g. session affinity), some nodes may have much lower hit rates.

### `full`

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| Dashboard shows ring | No — shows per-node fill rates and replication throughput |
| Peer-fetch metrics | Always zero |
| Purge propagation | < 1 s via HTTP fan-out |
| Replications sent/received | `bouine_cluster_replications_sent_total` and `_received_total` grow with cache fills |
| Node failure | No impact — every node holds a full replica |

**When things go wrong:**

- **Replication not reaching peers.** Check `bouine_cluster_replications_sent_total`
  on the fill node and `bouine_cluster_replications_received_total` on peers.
  If sent > 0 but received = 0, the gossip queue may be full.
  Check `bouine_cluster_replication_bytes_total` against the cluster bandwidth
  budget.

- **Memory pressure on individual nodes.** `full` mode stores the entire working
  set on every node. If `hot_max_bytes` is undersized, SIEVE eviction will
  evict recently-replicated objects. Symptoms:
  - Hit rate drops on nodes that recently received replications.
  - SIEVE eviction spikes visible via the dashboard.
  - Fix: increase `hot_max_bytes` to at least the total working set size, or
    switch to `eventual` or `strong` mode.

- **High cross-node bandwidth.** Replication gossip scales with fill rate ×
  object size. On a 5-node cluster with 1 000 cacheable fills/s and avg 50 KiB
  responses, replication bandwidth is ~50 MB/s per node. If you see bandwidth
  saturation, consider:
  - Switching to `strong` mode (one copy per key, no replication).
  - Reducing the cluster size (fewer nodes = fewer replication targets).
  - Increasing `hot_max_bytes` to reduce churn (fewer evictions = fewer re-fills).

## Memory and bandwidth budget

### `strong` mode

- Memory per node: working set ÷ N (where N = cluster size).
- Bandwidth: minimal. Peer-fetch RPCs are small (key hashes, HTTP headers).
  HTTP fan-out is infrequent (only on invalidation).

### `eventual` mode

- Memory per node: 1–N× depending on traffic overlap. With round-robin load
  balancing, expect ~1× (each node caches ~1/N of the working set).
- Bandwidth: minimal. Gossip invalidations only.

### `full` mode

- Memory per node: N× the working set. Every node holds every cached object.
- Bandwidth budget: `fills_per_second × avg_response_bytes × (cluster_size - 1)`.
  Example: 1 000 fills/s × 50 KiB × (5 - 1) = 200 MB/s per node.
  This is manageable on data-center networks but may saturate WAN links.

**Budget validation test:**

```bash
# Run a fill burst while watching replication metrics
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9000/metrics | grep bouine_cluster_replication'
```

For quantitative validation, run the integration test bandwidth check:
```bash
make integration-cluster-full
```

The `TestFull_ReplicationBandwidthMetric` test fills the cache on node 0 and
verifies `bouine_cluster_replication_bytes_total` increases on both the sender
and receiver sides.

## Switching modes

Mode changes require a full cluster restart. The procedure differs per mode:

### From `strong` to `eventual` or `full`

1. Update `cluster.mode` in your ConfigMap.
2. Rolling restart all pods one by one (`kubectl rollout restart statefulset/bouine`).
3. Verify `bouine_cluster_mode_info{mode="..."}` on every pod.

No data migration needed — each node starts with an empty cache.

### From `eventual` or `full` to `strong`

1. Update `cluster.mode: strong` in your ConfigMap.
2. Add `hop_limit` field if missing.
3. Rolling restart. The consistent-hash ring forms within seconds of all nodes
   joining.
4. Cache state from `eventual` is **not preserved** — nodes start with
   empty caches. Expect elevated miss rates for the first few minutes until
   caches warm up.

### From `full` to `eventual`

1. Update `cluster.mode: eventual`.
2. Rolling restart.
3. No data migration. Each node discards replicated objects and starts filling
   independently from origin.

## Troubleshooting quick reference

| Symptom | Mode | Probable cause | Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purge doesn't propagate | `strong` | Admin port unreachable | `bouine_cluster_invalidations_http_total` |
| Purge doesn't propagate | `eventual` | Gossip partition | `bouine_cluster_invalidations_gossip_total`, peers list |
| Stale reads | `eventual` | Gossip convergence window | Wait 5 s, re-check. If persistent, check gossip. |
| Low hit rate | `eventual` | Uneven node fill | Check per-node hit rates, consider `strong` |
| Node join fails | all | DNS not resolving | `kubectl get endpoints`, verify `publishNotReadyAddresses` |
